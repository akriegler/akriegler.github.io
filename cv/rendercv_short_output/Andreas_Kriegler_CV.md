# Summary

PhD student in Computer Vision at TU Wien, set to finish in late 2026.

I am a PhD student in Computer Vision at the [CVL](https://cvl.tuwien.ac.at/) at TU Wien. My supervisor is [Prof. Margrit Gelautz](https://informatics.tuwien.ac.at/people/margrit-gelautz). My research is funded by the [AIT Austrian Institute of Technology](https://www.ait.ac.at/) where I am further advised by [Csaba Beleznai](https://publications.ait.ac.at/en/persons/csaba.beleznai).

My research lies in the intersection of classical Computer Vision, Deep Learning and Computer Graphics. The goal is to develop novel methods for highly generic object pose estimation. We are specifically interested in the geometry of objects and exploit rendering engines to generate synthetic data.

Before joining the PhD program, I received my M.Sc. and B.Sc. degrees in Mechatronics/Robotics from the UAS Technikum Wien, both with distinction.
