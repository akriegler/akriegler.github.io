  abstract={A considerable amount of research is concerned with the challenging task of estimating three-dimensional (3D) pose and size for multi-object indoor scene con¯gurations. Many existing
models rely on a priori known object models, such as 3D CAD models and are therefore limited to a prede¯ned set of object categories. This closed-set constraint limits the range of applications
for robots interacting in dynamic environments where previously unseen objects may appear. This paper addresses this problem with a highly generic 3D bounding box detection method that
relies entirely on geometric cues obtained from depth data percepts. While the generation of synthetic data, e.g. synthetic depth maps, is commonly used for this task, the well-known synth-to-real gap often emerges, which prohibits transition of models trained solely on synthetic data to the real world. To ameliorate this problem, we use stereo depth computation on synthetic
data to obtain pseudo-realistic disparity maps. We then propose an intermediate representation, namely disparity-scaled surface normal (SN) images, which encodes geometry and at the
same time preserves depth/scale information unlike the commonly used standard SNs. In a series of experiments, we demonstrate the usefulness of our approach, detecting everyday
objects on a captured data set of tabletop scenes, and compare it to the popular PoseCNN model. We quantitatively show that standard SNs are less adequate for challenging 3D
detection tasks by comparing predictions from the model trained on disparity alone, SNs and disparity-scaled SNs. Additionally, in an ablation study we investigate the minimal number of
training samples required for such a learning task. Lastly, we make the tool used for 3D object annotation publicly available at: https://preview.tinyurl.com/3ycn8v5k. A video showcasing

Analyzing this context yields important cues for more holistic scene understanding.
While visual semantic context is often learned implicitly, this work proposes a simple algorithm to obtain explicit
priors and utilizes them in two ways: Firstly, irrelevant images are filtered during data aggregation, a key step to
improving domain coverage especially for public datasets. Secondly, context is used to predict the domains of objects of
interest. The framework is applied to the context around airplanes from ADE20K-SceneParsing, COCO-Stuff and PASCAL-Context.
As intermediate results, the context statistics were obtained to guide design and mapping choices for the merged dataset
SemanticAircraft and image patches were manually annotated in a one-hot manner across four aerial domains.
Three different methods predict domains of airplanes: An original threshold-algorithm
and unsupervised clustering models use context priors, a supervised CNN
works on input images with domain labels. All three models were able to
achieve acceptable prediction results, with the CNN obtaining accuracies of 69% to 85%. Additionally, context statistics and applied clustering

of machine learning methods in the age of deep learning, researchers in computer

  abstract={Mobile robot operations are becoming increasingly
sophisticated in terms of robust environment perception and
levels of automation. However, exploiting the great representational power of data-hungry learned representations is not
straightforward, as robotic tasks typically target diverse scenarios
with different sets of objects. Learning specific attributes of
frequently occurring object categories such as pedestrians and
vehicles, is feasible since labeled data-sets are plenty. On the
other hand, less common object categories call for the need
of use-case-specific data acquisition and labelling campaigns,
resulting in efforts which are not sustainable with a growing
number of scenarios. In this paper we propose a structure-aware
learning scheme, which represents geometric cues of specific
functional objects (airport loading ramp) in a highly invariant
manner, permitting learning solely from synthetic data, and also
leading to a great degree of generalization in real scenarios.
In our experiments we employ monocular depth estimation
for generating depth and surface normal data and in order
to express geometric traits instead of appearance. Using the
surface normals, we explore two different representations to learn
structural elements of the ramp object and decode its 3D pose: as
a set of key-points and as a set of 3D bounding boxes. Results are
demonstrated and validated in a series of robotic transportation
tasks, where the different representations are compared in terms
of recognition and metric space accuracy. Te proposed learning
scheme can be also easily applied to recognize arbitrary manmade functional objects (e.g. containers, tools) with and without
known dimensions.},

quality of the estimated depth data compares between different

Domains are an extension of semantic context across multiple images, specified by visual
features and form the environment objects most commonly appear in. Humans naturally use
these semantic relations to improve their environment perception but in computer vision literature only a handful of works exist that exploit context to significant extent.
While context is often learned implicitly in neural networks, this work provides an explicit
representation of context and utilizes context statistics in two ways. Using semantic context,
irrelevant images can be filtered during data aggregation, a key step to improving domain

The framework is applied to the aerial domain, specifically the context around airplanes from

a merged dataset, referred to as SemanticAircraft in this work. Three different methods were

CNN on the other hand works on input images with annotated domain-labels. All three models
were able to achieve satisfactory prediction results, with the CNN obtaining highest accuracies of 69% to 85% depending on the subset of SemanticAircraft. The results therefore meet
expectations – clusters found with the mixture models do not necessarily correspond to the
predefined domains and instead allow a more general analysis of the context statistics.}

The foundation of this thesis is an extensive state-of-the-art research to identify applications
of neural networks, classic machine learning and control algorithms for state transition modeling
and solving classification problems. The aim is to improve the generalization of an existing
system used at the Queensland University of Technology for place categorization, and to extend
the set of classes known to the system to relax the closed-set constraint. The system in its
original state was only capable of classification via the neural network, which did not generalize
well enough for immediate usage.
The convolutional neural network used for feature extraction of the image stream has been
augmented with trained machine learning models such as support vector machines and multi-
class logistic regression. The usage of these models has extended the classification to include
new place categories that are part of the finite set of classes, has helped to overcome uncer-
tainties from images showing features of multiple classes, and has removed the ambiguities
introduced by the Random Forest of One-vs-All classifiers employed in the original system.
The augmented system outperforms the basic neural network by correctly classifying 90% of
images (98% for the three-class environment) instead of only 78%, including a place that the
neural network was not trained on. In future projects, the images will be captured by mounting
the camera on a mobile robot, the classification will be expanded to all 12 of the distinct places
observable on campus, the semantic mapping system will be improved and the knowledge
acquired will be used to aid high-level path-planning decisions.},

surface of the molten pig iron to oxidize the carbon and create steel. During this process slag
is being created, which fills the converter. When it cannot be contained in the vessel any longer
it is forced out through the opening at the top. This event is called slopping and it pollutes the
surrounding environment and reduces the amount of steel yielded by the process. To avoid slopping, the person in charge of the process, refered to as the blower, needs to be provided
with accurate results of a slopping-forecast and slopping-detection system. They can then take
actions to lower the level of slag within the vessel.
Such a system has been developed in graphical programming (LabVIEW) numerous years
ago and it displays analysis data from optoacoustical measurement devices. Nonetheless, this
system is nowhere near the current state-of-the-art regarding both the Frontend and Backend
functionalities. The slopping-prediction is unreliable, and the human-machine interface (HMI)
does not follow the new companywide styleguide. Therefore, a new system is being developed
in this thesis, which provides the blower with an intuitive User Interface of the process.
Furthermore, multiple techniques for slopping-prediction and detection are combined in this
system.
An in-house MATLAB-framework is used for the basis of the program, in which modern object-
oriented programming techniques are prevalent. Interfaces with various components of the
system, such as two microphones, a camera, the Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) and a
database, are being developed and simulated. Following the styleguide, a clearly arranged
HMI is created and thoroughly tested. A complex machine-learning algorithm, which uses both
static and dynamic process data, is integrated into the system. Even though the system could
not be tested in real plant conditions, the simulations and results were promising. With this
algorithm, slopping could be detected in more than 85 out of a 100 analyzed heats.},
