I am a PhD Student in **Computer Vision** in the [CVL](https://cvl.tuwien.ac.at/) at [Technical University of Vienna (TU Wien)](https://www.tuwien.at/en/), 
supervised by [Margrit Gelautz](https://informatics.tuwien.ac.at/people/margrit-gelautz). I am funded by the [Austrian Institute of Technology (AIT)](https://www.ait.ac.at/en/), where I am further advised by 
[Csaba Beleznai](https://publications.ait.ac.at/de/persons/csaba.beleznai).

My research lies in the intersection of classical Computer Vision, Deep Learning and Computer Graphics, to develop novel methods for highly generic object pose estimation.
We are specifically interested in the geometry of objects and generate large quantities of synthetic data with rendering engines.

Before I joined TU Wien, I received both the BSc and MSc in Mechatronics/Robotics from the [University of Applied Sciences Technikum Wien](https://www.technikum-wien.at/en/) (with distinction).
